## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended - Full Stack)
**Best for:** Complete Next.js + API deployment

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Push code to GitHub
2. [ ] Connect Vercel to GitHub repository
3. [ ] Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   ```
4. [ ] Deploy and test

**Pros:** ✅ Easy setup, ✅ Automatic deployments, ✅ Built-in API routes
**Cons:** ❌ Serverless limitations for database

### Option 2: Netlify + Railway (Separate Frontend/Backend)
**Best for:** Static frontend with separate backend

**Frontend (Netlify):**
1. [ ] Configure `netlify.toml` (already created)
2. [ ] Set environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
3. [ ] Deploy frontend

**Backend (Railway):**
1. [ ] Create Railway project
2. [ ] Connect GitHub repository (backend folder)
3. [ ] Set environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   PORT=3001
   ```
4. [ ] Deploy backend

**Pros:** ✅ Scalable backend, ✅ Good performance
**Cons:** ❌ More complex setup, ❌ Two deployments to manage

### Option 3: Docker (Self-hosted)
**Best for:** Full control, custom infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Configure production Docker files
2. [ ] Set up production environment variables
3. [ ] Deploy to your hosting provider
4. [ ] Configure SSL certificates
5. [ ] Set up monitoring

**Pros:** ✅ Full control, ✅ Custom configuration
**Cons:** ❌ More maintenance, ❌ Infrastructure management
